# DT Screening - Todo List
Simple Todo List made for the screening purposes. This is to assess the knowledge of the candidate in using **plain CSS and Javascript**. 

## Development Process

_**DESIGN**_

After Visualizing the output,I then proceed to create the boilerplate.  
Next is creating the initial design. Then slowly crteating some functionalities. Lastly, Apply responsiveness._

<hr style="border: 2px solid #lightgrey; border-radius: 10px;">

_**FUNCTIONALITY**_
>_Create a No Task Message and a checker for No Task.  
Then, I proceed to creating the other functions. e.g. Add Task, Delete, Mark as Finished.  
The checkbox is used for marking the task as Finished. Lastly, I added the Delete All function._

# Brief Task Overview

>I wasn't able to finish the task within 2 hours, although it was not required. I was more familiar with the framework, so I had to search for documentation online. When the time was at the 2-hour mark, only then did I seek AI assistance to provide me with possible solutions.
